## 💡 Why Choose DeepAcquire

**DeepAcquire** aims to be the **"Cursor of language learning"**. Just as Cursor changed how we write code by deeply integrating AI into the workflow, DeepAcquire transforms how we learn languages by integrating AI into content consumption.

### 1. AI-Refined Subtitles

We don't just show native YouTube subtitles. We use AI to improve the original auto-generated ones. DeepAcquire corrects punctuation, fixes sentence break errors, and provides a cleaner, more readable subtitle experience than the default.

### 2. Adaptive Explanations

This is where the "AI-First" philosophy shines. The AI explains vocabulary based on the **specific video context** and your **current proficiency level**.

- **For Beginners:** It uses simple vocabulary to explain concepts.
- **For Advanced Learners:** It provides nuance explanations and example sentences relevant to your daily life.

### 3. Deep Dives & Q&A

This is the key difference: you can "chat" directly with the video. For example:

- Confused by two similar-looking words?

  > **Ask DeepAcquire:** "Are these two words etymologically related?"

- Or struggling to distinguish subtle differences between synonyms?
  > **Ask DeepAcquire:** "Why do we use A instead of B in this current scenario?"

You don't need to leave the immersive video environment. DeepAcquire is aware of the video context you're watching. With one click, you get precise, context-aware explanations and analysis, which can be synced to your vocabulary book for future review.

### 4. Contextual Recall

When reviewing words, we don't just show "Word -> Native Meaning". We save the **exact scene and context** where you first encountered the word. This helps you recall that "moment," making the memory stronger than a mechanical definition.

### 5. Shadowing Mode

DeepAcquire introduces a **Shadowing Mode** designed for focused reading and speaking practice. It highlights the word being pronounced, letting you focus on the current word and sentence, mimicking natural speech flow. This helps you track pronunciation more easily and improve listening and speaking skills.
